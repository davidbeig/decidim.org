> “We have been busy building Decidim, now it is time to think it through.” (p. vii)

Today marks the 7th anniversary of Decidim’s birth. As a gift, we release its book: [“Decidim, a technopolitical network for participatory democracy. Philosophy, practice, and autonomy of a collective platform in the age of Digital Intelligence"](https://link.springer.com/book/9783031507830) (2024, Springer). Born in Barcelona on February 1st, 2017, Decidim has experienced a relentless growth. It has expanded to over 30 countries, boasting 500 active installations and 3 million participants worldwide. It coordinates hundreds of participation processes, and is designed to facilitate, broaden, and catalyse democracy. Alongside the platform, its community has flourished, now encompassing thousands of members globally. This book is a testament to that journey.



> “We distinguish three general levels or dimensions of the project: the political (focused on the democratic model that Decidim promotes, on its impacts on public policies and organisations and on society more broadly), the technopolitical (focused on how the platform is designed, the politics it embodies and the way in which it is itself democratically governed) and the technical (focused on the conditions of production, operation and success of the project—the digital factory, collaborative mechanisms, licences, training, etc.).” (p. 7)

The book aims for a holistic and systematic review of the project. It delves into each of its layers - political, technopolitical, and technical - with thorough detail. The book captures Decidim's evolution in all its facets, acknowledging the challenges and limitations of writing about a dynamic, open, and ever-evolving project.

> “A radical reading of participation as pars capere inter pares, as taking part as peers, points towards a stronger form of politics and also towards an alternative form of society. Decidim is a software and a project oriented to embody and promote that vision.” (p. 127)

This book ventures deep into Decidim and goes further, offering a chance to discuss not just its capabilities, goals, and practices, but also to present a strong conception of democracy and to explore new political horizons for digital societies. It critically addresses technological development and its societal impacts, acknowledging risks while proposing viable, sustainable pathways into the future. It even briefly touches upon debates surrounding collective intelligence in the face of the latest Artificial Intelligence wave.

> “This book is only a thread in a thick web” (p. vii)

We offer this book as both a toolkit and a political device for action and thought. Starting with Decidim itself, the present text provides a reference framework for unfolding democratic technologies. Thus, it represents a working method, a conceptual and theoretical framework, embedding a collective vision about democracy, social autonomy, movements, institutional transformation, and the commons.

We invite not just to read this book, but to actively engage with it and transcend its boundaries. In true Decidim spirit, this work is copyleft, open, freedom enhancing, and collaborative: you are free to copy, modify, and distribute it, always adhering to the CC-BY-SA licence.

> “In an age of disbelief and despair, of hypermediatically narrated doom and collapse, this is a necessary step: to take part in the reimagining and recrafting of the future. Hopefully, Decidim and Metadecidim will help to such a recraft of our collective selves (and also our personal ones) along with our present and future worlds.” (p. 131)

This work is the culmination of a seven-year collective endeavour involving countless individuals. Their contributions have been indispensable. For this reason, we want to close this post by celebrating the participation in Decidim, and by inviting everyone to engage with us in the technopolitical battles (and peaces) of the present and the future.

> “Beyond hope or fear, Decidim is a new weapon in the struggle for real democracy. This book ends here. Decidim continues”. (p. 132)

Long live Decidim, and happy reading!
